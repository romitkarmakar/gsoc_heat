## **Contest Rules and Guidelines**
1. Stick to the timeline. We are very strict about timeline since GSoC is very strict at its timeline too and no requests for extension is entertained.
2. You can submit maximum of 1 proposal only!
3. Follow the application template as provided.
4. You are free to discuss about the proposal and take feedback from the maintainers before submission. Make a google doc and give permissions to the specific maintainer of the project to comment on it and give feedback for your proposal.
5. Share the link of your google doc in our mailing list to make it easier to review it. Create a new thread with topic `GSoC Heat proposal by <your_name>`
6. Submit the final proposal in pdf format. No changes can be done to your proposal once submitted and you can't resubmit the same proposal. So be sure before you submit the final link.
7. You can submit the links to the work done during the coding period in a blog post, gist or google doc.
